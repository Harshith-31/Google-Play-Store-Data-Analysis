Genres
Last Updated
🔹 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
NumPy (Numerical Analysis)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook
🔹 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed duplicate records
Handled missing values
Converted Installs & Price into numeric format
Standardized rating and review columns
Removed outliers affecting statistical analysis
This ensured high data integrity before analysis.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed structured EDA to understand:
Distribution of app ratings
Category-wise install trends
Free vs Paid app performance
Price vs Rating relationship
Reviews vs Installs correlation
🔹 Key Insights Extracted
📌 1. Free Apps Dominate Install Volume
Free apps significantly outperform paid apps in total installs, indicating user price sensitivity.
📌 2. High Reviews Strongly Correlate with Installs
Apps with higher review counts tend to have higher installs, suggesting social proof influences adoption.
📌 3. Certain Categories Drive Growth
Categories like Tools, Entertainment, and Communication show higher engagement levels.
📌 4. Pricing Strategy Matters
Higher-priced apps tend to have lower install counts, except in niche productivity segments.
📌 5. Rating Distribution is Positively Skewed
Most apps cluster between 4.0–4.5 rating range.
🔹 Business Impact & Practical Use
This analysis can help:
App developers optimize pricing strategy
Product teams improve user acquisition tactics
Marketing teams focus on high-growth categories
Investors identify scalable app segments
The project demonstrates how raw app marketplace data can be transformed into strategic insights.
